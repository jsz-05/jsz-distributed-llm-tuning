    (
        "What happens if a priority graph contains cycles?",
        "If a priority graph contains cycles, it can lead to deadlock situations where agents are stuck waiting for each other to release resources. This prevents any agent from making progress and can cause the entire system to halt."
    ),
    (
        "How does an agent transition from 'thinking' to 'eating'?",
        "An agent transitions from 'thinking' to 'eating' by first entering the 'hungry' state, sending a request token to the OS agent, and then receiving the resource token. Once the resource token is received, the agent can enter the critical section and eat."
    ),
    (
        "What is the role of the OS agent in maintaining mutual exclusion?",
        "The OS agent maintains mutual exclusion by managing the distribution of resource tokens. It ensures that only one agent can hold the resource token at a time, preventing multiple agents from accessing the critical section simultaneously."
    ),
    (
        "Why is it important to have a partial order of priorities?",
        "A partial order of priorities is important because it helps in resolving conflicts among agents by establishing a clear hierarchy. This structure prevents deadlocks and ensures that agents with higher priorities can access resources before those with lower priorities."
    ),
    (
        "How does an agent handle a request for a resource while it is eating?",
        "While an agent is eating, it registers any received requests for the resource in memory. Once the agent finishes eating and transitions to the 'thinking' state, it sends the resource to the requesting neighbors, ensuring fair resource distribution."
    ),
    (
        "What is the significance of the 'leads-to' relationship in a priority graph?",
        "The 'leads-to' relationship in a priority graph signifies the causal connection between agents' states. It helps ensure that higher-priority agents can access resources before lower-priority ones, maintaining orderly progression and preventing deadlocks."
    ),
    (
        "Explain the role of the variant function in proving mutual exclusion properties.",
        "The variant function is used to prove mutual exclusion properties by ensuring it does not increase while an agent remains in a particular state (e.g., hungry). It helps demonstrate that agents will eventually transition out of that state, ensuring progress and preventing starvation."
    ),
    (
        "What does it mean for an agent to be in the 'waiting to enter critical section' state?",
        "An agent in the 'waiting to enter critical section' state is waiting for permission from the OS agent to access the critical section. It holds the request token and is ready to transition to the 'in critical section' state once it receives the resource token."
    ),
    (
        "How does an OS agent handle the resource token when a client is in the 'thinking' state?",
        "When a client is in the 'thinking' state, the OS agent retains the resource token or may hold it until another client requests it. The client in the 'thinking' state holds only the request token, indicating it is not currently attempting to access the critical section."
    ),
    (
        "Describe the transition process from 'eating' to 'thinking' for a client.",
        "The transition process from 'eating' to 'thinking' involves the client finishing its task in the critical section, sending the resource token back to the OS agent, and retaining the request token. This indicates the client is no longer using the shared resource and is now in the 'thinking' state."
    ),
    (
        "What is the importance of the 'outside critical section' state in mutual exclusion?",
        "The 'outside critical section' state is important because it indicates that the agent is not currently attempting to access the shared resource. This state allows the agent to perform other tasks or decide when to request access to the critical section, ensuring flexible and fair resource usage."
    ),
    (
        "How does the OS agent manage client state transitions in the dining philosophers problem?",
        "The OS agent manages client state transitions by holding and distributing tokens. It grants permission for clients to enter the critical section by sending the resource token when the client is hungry and requests access, ensuring orderly and fair resource usage."
    ),
    (
        "What is the role of the request token in indicating a client's state?",
        "The request token indicates that the client is either thinking or has just finished eating. It signifies the client's intention to request access to the critical section but is not currently holding the resource token."
    ),
    (
        "Why must the priority graph be acyclic in a distributed system?",
        "The priority graph must be acyclic to prevent deadlocks. An acyclic graph ensures that there is always a clear path of priority, allowing agents to resolve conflicts and make progress without getting stuck waiting for each other."
    ),
    (
        "How do agents use the resource token to ensure mutual exclusion?",
        "Agents use the resource token to ensure mutual exclusion by granting exclusive access to the critical section. Only the agent holding the resource token can enter the critical section, preventing conflicts and ensuring orderly access to the shared resource."
    ),
    (
        "What is the significance of the 'leads-to' relationship in client-OS interactions?",
        "The 'leads-to' relationship in client-OS interactions signifies the causal connection between the client's state and the OS agent's knowledge of that state. It ensures that state transitions lead to the desired state changes over time, demonstrating progress in the system."
    ),
    (
        "How does an agent know when to yield a fork in the dining philosophers problem?",
        "An agent knows when to yield a fork based on its priority relative to its neighbors. If the agent has a lower priority or if retaining the fork would lead to starvation for a neighbor, it should yield the fork to ensure fair resource distribution."
    ),
    (
        "What ensures progress in a mutual exclusion algorithm?",
        "Progress in a mutual exclusion algorithm is ensured by the partial order of priorities and the variant function. These elements ensure that agents will eventually transition out of waiting states, preventing starvation and deadlocks."
    ),
    (
        "Describe the state of an agent that is 'waiting to enter critical section.'",
        "An agent 'waiting to enter critical section' holds the request token and is waiting for the resource token from the OS agent. It is ready to transition to the 'in critical section' state once it receives the resource token, indicating its intention to access the shared resource."
    ),
    (
        "How does the OS agent prevent deadlocks in the dining philosophers problem?",
        "The OS agent prevents deadlocks by managing the distribution of resource tokens based on the clients' priorities and states. It ensures that no two agents can hold the resource token simultaneously and that higher-priority agents are granted access first."
    ),
    (
        "What is the role of the resource token in indicating a client's state?",
        "The resource token indicates that the client has exclusive access to the critical section and is currently performing its task. When the client holds the resource token, it signifies that the client is in the 'in critical section' state."
    ),
    (
        "How does an agent transition from 'hungry' to 'eating' in the dining philosophers problem?",
        "An agent transitions from 'hungry' to 'eating' by sending its request token to the OS agent, indicating its intention to eat. When the OS agent grants the resource token, the agent can enter the critical section and start eating."
    ),
    (
        "What is the significance of the partial order of priorities in conflict resolution?",
        "The partial order of priorities is significant in conflict resolution because it ensures that there is a clear hierarchy among agents, preventing cycles and deadlocks. This structure helps agents resolve conflicts and make progress in accessing shared resources."
    ),
    (
        "How does an agent handle multiple fork requests while eating?",
        "While eating, an agent registers any received fork requests in memory. Once the agent finishes eating and transitions to the 'thinking' state, it sends the forks to the requesting neighbors, ensuring fair resource distribution and preventing starvation."
    ),
    (
        "Why is it important to have a finite critical section period?",
        "Having a finite critical section period is important to ensure that agents do not monopolize the shared resource, allowing other agents to access it. This prevents starvation and ensures fair and orderly resource usage among agents."
    ),
    (
        "What does the request token signify in a client's state transition?",
        "The request token signifies that the client is either thinking or has just finished eating. It indicates the client's intention to request access to the critical section but is not currently holding the resource token, showing the client is not actively accessing the shared resource."
    ),
